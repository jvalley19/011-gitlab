# Lab 11: GitLab CICD Pipeline

In this lab, we will setup a GitLab CICD pipeline, which will build the source code to a docker image and push it to the container registry in GitLab and then re-deploy the docker container with the latest image in our local host.

## Lab goal

Understand how to setup/configure Gitlab as CICD pipeline. Familarize with gitlab pipeline.
